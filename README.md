# Computations of benzoic acid surrogates 
All the calculations were performed at the DFT level of theory with the M06-2x functional and a triple zeta potential basis set (aug-cc-pvtz) as implemented in Gaussian 16.  NBO charges (**NBO**), IR frequencies (**v_C=O**) and intensities (**I_C=O**), dipole moments (**dp**), polarizability (**polar**), LUMO/HOMO energies (**LUMO/HOMO**), C1-C2 bond length (**L_C1-C2**), occupancy and energy (**Occupancy/Energy**) were obtained from the optimized structures.  Sterimol parameters (**Ster_L**, **Ster_B1**, **Ster_B5**) were calculated from the optimized geometries using ᴍᴏʀғᴇᴜs in Python (version 3.11.7) under Jupyterlab (version 3.5.0) environment.  For aryl groups in N-aryl-N´-alkylindigos, conformational sampling was carried out using AFIR to identify the few conformers with the lowest energies, which were reoptimized to obtain the most stable geometries.
# Modelling procedure
Multivariate linear regression models were constructed from the above datasets using Python (version 3.11.7) under Jupyterlab (version 3.5.0) environment.  The values were first normalized, and then the combinations of parameters were screened for high R2 and low rmse (root-mean-square error).  The superior combinations were then checked by LOO (leave-one-out) validation to ensure reasonable Q2 could be obtained.
